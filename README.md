- 👋 Hi, I’m @rsgrizz  
- 👀 I’m interested in digital forensics, cybersecurity, OSINT, and file system analysis.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced forensic techniques for NTFS, ExFAT, and HFS+, along with automation using PowerShell and Python.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on forensic tooling, data recovery scripts, and cybersecurity investigations.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve analyzed hidden laptops, altered EXIF data, and uncovered corporate espionage cases—just another day in digital forensics!
